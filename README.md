# FlexTestJS
Simple and flexible test system for NodeJS. No-frills, ~100 lines of code. Small enough to be easily understood. Add your desired features or customize the run-tests.js file to suit your needs. Plugins welcome.

Simply run 'run-tests.js' to execute each file under ./tests/ . Copy the template under the respository ./tests/ folder and name it such that it mirrors your source file tree (this is a soft covention, it won't affect testing). Typically you could place this within the root of your source folder along with a tests folder, or you can adjust the import variable in the tests to match your new location.
